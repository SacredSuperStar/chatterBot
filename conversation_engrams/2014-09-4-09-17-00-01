Bilbo,0,"Good Morning!"
Gandalf,0,"What do you mean?"
Gandalf,0,"Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"
Bilbo,0,"All of them at once"
Bilbo,0,"And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain."
Gandalf,0,"Good morning!"
Bilbo,0,"We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water."
Gandalf,0,"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!"
Gandalf,0,"Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off."
