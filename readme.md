# ChatterBot

This library allows developers to create language independent chat bots that
return responses to based on collections of known conversations.

An example of typical input would be something like this:
> user: Good morning! How are you doing?  
> bot:  I am doing very well, thank you for asking.  
> user: Your welcome.  
> bot: Do you like hats?  

## Installation

This package can be installed using
```
pip install chatterbot
```

## Useage

Create a new chat bot
```
from chatterbot import ChatBot
chatbot = ChatBot()
```

Getting an engram based response
```
response = chatbot.engram("Good morning!")
print(response)
```

Specify a defult location for engram memory files  
**Note:** The default log directory is `conversation_engrams/`.
```
chatbot.log_directory = "path/to/directory/"
```

Setting the chatbot's name  
**Note:** The default name for the bot is `bot`.
```
chatbot.name = "Mr. Robot"
```

Terminal mode (User and chat bot)
```
from chatterbot import Terminal
terminal = Terminal()
terminal.begin()
```

Have the chat bot talk with CleverBot
```
from chatterbot import TalkWithCleverbot
talk = TalkWithCleverbot()
talk.begin()
```

## A general warning

This program is capable of retrieving conversation data from various social networks
in order to provide more accurate replies to input text. Because of this,
responces generated by the chat bot can contain insulting statements completely at random.
I have plans to address this issue, however they are not yet implemented.

## Notes

This program is not designed to be an open source version of CleverBot.
Although this **Chat Bot** returns responces, the code here handles communication
much differently then [CleverBot](http://www.cleverbot.com) does.
